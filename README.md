# rick-and-morty-api-

Hi there, this is my project, here using the Rick and Morty api 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api';
iÂ´m building a tribute page, with all the info of characters, episodes, and locations. 

1.1 created the interface, added minimal bootstrap to test, implemented all the calls and the functions from the api. 

1.2 logic: implemented all the calls from the API, created the episode screen
